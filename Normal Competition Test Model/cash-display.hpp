     object. It seems natural that one defines button2() and button3() as
     a method of the simulation object, because this allows button2() and
     button3() to have direct access to CellularAutomata. But, according
     to C++, the pointer to a method of an object instance is different
     from the usual C function pointer. Hence, unfortunately, button2()
     and button3() defined as a method of the simulation object can not
     directly be given to handle_mouse_event(). To solve this, one must
     define a wrapper, a normal C function which calls either button2() or
     button3() "for the focal object instant", and one gives a pointer to
     this wrapper to handle_mouse_event.
